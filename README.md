# Amarok2Rhythmbox

This is a very old Perl script that I wrote to transfer my Amarok music collection database over to Rhythmbox.

I have kept the script here in a public repository just in case it can help somebody, however this is in no way an active or maintaied project.

If it's of any use to you then my work here is done :)
